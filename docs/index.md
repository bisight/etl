BiSight ETL is a simple, extensible and powerful E(xtract), T(ransform), L(oad) application and library.

It provides a pluggable set of Extractors, Transformers and Loaders. New and/or custom extensions can
be easily integrated by implementing one of the 3 interfaces: `ExtractorInterface`, `TransformerInterface` and `LoaderInterface`.
