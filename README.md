# BiSight ETL

BiSight ETL is a simple, extensible and powerful E(xtract), T(ransform), L(oad) application and library.

It provides a pluggable set of Extractors, Transformers and Loaders. New and/or custom extensions can
be easily integrated by implementing one of the 3 interfaces.

## What is ETL ?

According to [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)

> In computing, Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) refers to a process in database usage and especially in data warehousing that:
>
> * Extracts data from homogeneous or heterogeneous data sources
> * Transforms the data for storing it in proper format or structure for querying and analysis purpose
> * Loads it into the final target (database, more specifically, operational data store, data mart, or data warehouse)
